# Welcome to the Docker Captains! 


By becoming a member of this program, you agree to abide by the following Code of Conduct. This is to ensure that the Captains are a respected, professional group that has a positive impact in the ecosystem. The Code of Conduct is not a comprehensive list of do’s and don’ts, but rather a living set of guidelines to follow that we will continue to refine as the program matures. You are responsible for keeping abreast of changes to this document. 


*If you need further clarification or are unable to fulfill any of the following guidelines, [please let us know as soon as possible](mailto:thea@docker.com).*


## Embody the Docker Community Code of Conduct


All Docker community members should strive to follow our [community guidelines](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#docker-community-guidelines). As a Docker Captain, it is especially important to lead by showing model behavior at all times, both in person and online.  
+ Be a force for good in the community.
+ Keep up-to-date on the latest technological advances in Docker and the ecosystem. 
+ Promote and support inclusivity, respect, and professionalism in the tech community.  
+ Positively represent the Docker Captains at industry events and online. 
+ Be supportive of Docker community members when engaging in programs related to the Docker Captains. 

## Understand Docker beyond containers


As a Captain, you understand that Docker is a technology stack; you have a working understanding of all the pieces (Engine, Swarm, Machine, Compose, etc.) and how they fit together. You may use and talk about other Docker ecosystem tools as part of your work or personal projects, but you are still enthusiastic about Docker as a whole technology and platform.
Prepare balanced and accurate content. 
+ Be respectful in your mentions of other vendors, technologies, and communities in the ecosystem.
+ Strive to produce content that is educational, accurate, and free from sales pitches. 
+ Do not slander or publish libel against Docker or other people and companies.
+ Be rigorous in researching your content. If you need help validating results and analyses, reach out for assistance. 
+ If you experience difficulties with Docker products, programs or community members, give us the opportunity to address your feedback in advance. 
+ Keep information under embargo confidential. 

As one of the perks of being a Docker Captain, you will receive regular updates about Docker products and releases ahead of the general public. Respect this privilege by keeping this information confidential until the agreed-upon time. Managers of the Docker Captains program will announce to the group when this information can be shared with the public

## Enforcing this Code of Conduct


Docker reserves the right to remove any member from the Docker Captains program for violating this Code of Conduct. In the event of a violation, the Docker Captains Program managers will review the situation and determine the consequences on a case by case basis. When a Docker Captain is removed from the program, we retire the remaining benefits and his or her access to Docker resources.
