# Docker Birthday #3


This year, to celebrate the Docker Project’s 3rd birthday, the Docker community is joining forces with a number of partners in the broader tech and open-source community to host a series of events focused on providing Docker training to beginners during the week of March 21-26. 

Based on the feedback we’ve received from Docker meetup organizers, we learned that many meetup attendees are new to Docker and we want to make sure that we welcome them warmly into the Docker community. To ensure that these events are inclusive for everyone attending including underrepresented minorities, we’re happy to announce that we have teamed up with the following partners who’re actively contributing to organizing many Docker Birthday celebrations around the world:

- [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)
- [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- [Joyent & the NodeJS community](https://www.joyent.com/developers/node)
- [GoBridge] (http://golangbridge.org/)
- [Women Who Go] (http://www.womenwhogo.org/)
- [Ruby Central] (http://rubycentral.org/)

Without revealing too many details at this points, participants in the training will go through the steps involved in running and developing a simple voting app from a fresh computer using Docker Toolbox and Compose. This simple app will include:

- A Python webapp which lets you vote between several options
- A Redis queue which collects new votes
- A Java worker which consumes votes and stores them in…
- …A Postgres database backed by a Docker volume
- A Node.js webapp which shows the results of the voting in real timedocker-toolbox

There will be a self-paced beginners’ tutorial for attendees to learn Docker basics as they build and deploy this app locally. Experienced Docker users will serve as mentors to help beginners successfully complete the training.
