# Ready to start your own Docker Meetup Chapter?
Docker Chapter events are organized by community members who are interested in talking and learning about Docker. Anyone can start a Docker Chapter as long as there isn’t already a Docker Chapter group in your city. We simply ask our organizers to comply with our Code of Conduct and work with them to ensure everyone in the community is feeling welcome!

Look for potential speakers living in your city

# Am I allowed to use the Docker logo ?
You are allowed to use the Docker logo on the chapter group page as long as you respect our [code of conduct](https://github.com/docker/code-of-conduct). Check out our [brand guidlines](https://www.docker.com/brand-guidelines) and the [Docker media kit](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/legal/docker_logos_2018.zip) to choose which versions of the Docker logo you’d like to use.

# What happens if I no longer have time to run a Docker chapter group?
We really appreciate all the contributions Docker Community Leaders make to the Docker community. Although we hope to collaborate with you in the long term, we totally understand it if you have to step down as an organizer, just reach out and let us know whether or not you’ve found a substitute. Reach out to the Docker team and we can help find someone who wants to step up and help organize events moving forward.
