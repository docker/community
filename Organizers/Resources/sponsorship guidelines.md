# Docker Meetup Sponsorship Guidelines

## Why sponsor?

Build brand awareness in your local community by sponsoring a Docker Meetup. Benefits of a sponsorship may include but aren't limited to:
- Listing as a sponsor on the meetup.com page (left column)
- Listing in the event details meetup page
- Recognition in pre- and/or post-event emails
- Verbal thank you in opening or closing remarks
- Digital promotion of event

Three sponsorship options available:
- Venue Host sponsorship
- Food/ Beverage sponsorship
- Venue + Food/ Beverage sponsorship

Thank you to all our wonderful sponsors!

## General Sponsorship FAQ

#### Can we present a talk at the event we sponsor?
Yes, as long as the talk is not a sales pitch. Another option is a 2-5 minute intro at the beginning of the event.

#### Do you offer annual sponsorship packages?
In an effort to keep our meetup events neutral, we mostly welcome ad hoc sponsorships. If you are interested in a recurring or global sponsorship, please contact Docker at meetups@docker.com

#### What is the agenda for a typical meetup?
A typical meetup involves a few speaker presentations and some time for Q&A. Speaker presentations usually vary from one to three presenters who typically speak from 30 minutes to one hour. Events usually start in the evening around 6-7PM. Your local organizer contact will be able to give you the full details for their city.


## Venue Host FAQ

#### How many guests will be invited?
The entire meetup group will be invited but the actual rsvp number is up to the capacity of your venue.

#### As a venue host, what do I need to provide?				
As the venue host, you will provide the event space, Wi-Fi and A/V equipment (microphone and projection capabilities). Please confirm with your local organizer contact.

#### Do I need to sponsor food and beverages?
While we often secure a separate sponsor for food and beverages, many venues are also able to provide food and beverages for the event. A typical meal is pizza and a selection of soft drinks and beer, but other meal options are definitely well-received by the attendees.

## Food/ Beverage Sponsor FAQ			

#### Do we need to provide vegetarian/gluten-free/vegan meal options?
We ask for a vegetarian option to be served but we do not require vegan or gluten-free options.

#### What does a typical meal look like? 
A typical meal is pizza and a selection of soft drinks and beer. Talk to your local organizer for average prices.
